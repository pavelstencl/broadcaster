# Broadcaster: Cross Window Serverless State Manager

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/@broadcaster%2Freact.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/@broadcaster%2Freact)

Small package for managing communication between different
[browsing contexts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Browsing_context), like tabs, windows, iFrames, workers, etc..

This package not only preserves the state of each instance but also shares the current states with remote counterparts.
Under the hood, it utilizes the [BroadcastChannel API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Broadcast_Channel_API),
yet it can be effortlessly replaced with any alternative communication strategy.

## Key features

 * üöå **BUS between browsing contexts**  
 Allows to share a state and messages between different browsing contexts.
 * **Serverless**  
 By default, the Broadcaster employs the [BroadcastChannel API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Broadcast_Channel_API) as its primary bridge interface. This API enables fundamental communication between different browsing contexts such as windows and tabs, eliminating the necessity for a server.
 * üìù **Context aware**  
Each instance of the Broadcaster maintains awareness of other instances throughout their lifecycle. It retains essential information and state, making this data accessible to every Broadcaster instance subscribed to the same channel.
 * üí™ **Accessible on most modern browsers and Node.JS** 
 In 2023 all main browsers supports BroadcastChannel API (Most recently Safari v 15.4) - [see caniuse](https://caniuse.com/?search=BroadcastChannel)
 * ‚öôÔ∏è‚öôÔ∏è‚öôÔ∏è **Modular**  
Given Broadcaster's significant dependence on the BroadcastChannel API, users have the flexibility to alter the communication protocol by simply replacing the Bridge instance.
